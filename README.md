# Medieval: an interdisciplinary, randomized, single-blind expert-evaluation of large language models for their implications and risks in medical diagnosis and management

## üìÑ Abstract

### Importance:
Despite efforts to benchmark large language models (LLMs), direct clinical uses of LLMs remain controversial. Rigorous evaluation by medical expert panels can help assess the risks and benefits of LLMs in the clinical setting, but methodological development for such purposes remain lacking.
### Objective:
To assess the capability of LLM to perform diagnosis and treatment planning for clinical cases under a multi-disciplinary, randomized, and blinded expert evaluation framework.
### Design, Setting, and Participants:
We designed a diverse set of 685 real and simulated clinical cases across 13 specialties and prompted LLMs with these cases. We developed a web-based system for experts to rate the LLM responses in a randomized and blinded manner from March 8 to 31, 2025. Our expert panel consisted of 27 clinicians with an average of 25.9 years of clinical experience.
### Main Outcomes and Measures:
An expert panel rated the diagnoses and treatment plans of each LLM using a scoring system designed to assess the quality of the LLM responses equivalent to that of human physicians at various career stages.
### Results:
LLM response ratings (n = 9856) by individual experts are heterogeneous but the averaged ratings have excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9). The LLM responses to clinical cases were rated on average to be equivalent to attending physicians in the Chinese medical system; however, the LLM responses were often rated to be equivalent to fresh medical graduates or worse (3-19%). Additionally, 40 instances of LLM hallucination were identified, and these involve fabricated clinical conditions, inappropriate medical prescriptions, and severe diagnostic errors.

### Conclusions and Relevance:
While LLMs show substantial values in enhancing operational efficiency, their unguarded clinical application could present serious risks. Human expert oversight remains crucial. Larger, multi-center studies are warranted to assess their real-world performance, and the clinical adoption of LLMs must be continuously monitored by expert panels. The evaluation framework developed and validated in this study will facilitate efforts to assess and monitor the clinical application of LLMs.

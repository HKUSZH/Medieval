# Medieval: an interdisciplinary, randomized, single-blind expert-evaluation of large language models for their implications and risks in medical diagnosis and management

## 📄 Abstract

### Background  
State-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in fields such as mathematics and computer science. However, their medical proficiency remains underexplored due to the complexity of clinical contexts and lack of rigorous evaluation frameworks.

### Methods  
We conducted a randomized, single-blind, single-center study in which 27 specialty experts (associate consultant level or above) evaluated the medical performance of seven LLMs across **685 questions** — a balanced mix of simulated OSCE-style and real clinical cases (48.9% real), drawn from **13 medical disciplines**.  
Experts assessed:
- **Medical strength** (0–10 scale: 0 = no knowledge, >9.5 = leading expert)
- **Hallucinations** (0–5 scale: 1 point per fabricated element)

Models were assessed via a custom-designed, anonymized web interface. Evaluator responses were subject to exclusion criteria for rushed (<2 hours), incomplete (<95%), or repetitive (>20% same-score) submissions. Analysis was performed using multiple linear regression and linear mixed-effects models, with response length included as a covariate.

### Findings  
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** achieved the highest raw scores but produced notably longer responses.  
- **DeepSeek R1** outperformed others when adjusted for length, ranking highest in both rank-based and mixed-model analyses.  
- As of March 2025, the best-performing models matched the proficiency of senior attending physicians in multiple specialties, with low incidence of hallucinations.

### Interpretation  
LLMs demonstrated strong capabilities in diagnostic reasoning but underperformed in sequential and spatial reasoning tasks. While promising for clinical use, deployment in real-world medical contexts should be approached with caution.
